# App Flow Document: Crypto Regulatory Compliance Checker

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user lands on the Crypto Regulatory Compliance Checker, they are welcomed with a clear landing page that explains the purpose of the app and how it can help them evaluate the regulatory compliance of their tokenomics documents. The landing page gives a brief overview of the app’s capabilities, including document uploads and analysis of potential compliance issues. Although the initial version does not enforce user authentication, a minimal sign-up and sign-in process is outlined for future enhancements. Users may simply proceed to the document upload without needing to register, but a hidden option exists for users who wish to create an account using their email. The password recovery or reset process is indicated as a future feature, ensuring that any transition to enforced authentication and security measures can be implemented without disrupting the current simple flow.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After entering the application, the user is taken directly to the main dashboard, which serves as the hub for all interactions. This home page features a clean and straightforward interface where the primary functionality is immediately visible. At the top, a header explains the app’s purpose and quick tips on document uploads, while a central area invites users to drag and drop or manually select their tokenomics documents in PDF and DOCX formats. A prominent status area provides real-time feedback on uploads, and navigation options allow the user to access previously processed reports and future alert settings. With minimal visual clutter, the main dashboard ensures users know exactly where to start and how to navigate the app for subsequent tasks such as reviewing analysis results or investigating flagged problematic areas in their documents.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once the user initiates the document upload from the dashboard, the application (on the upload page) verifies file formats and securely accepts the selected files. As the user drops or selects a file, the interface provides immediate visual confirmation indicating that the upload is in progress. Simultaneously in the backend, the system begins to queue the document for analysis. Parallel to the user document upload, the backend starts scraping global crypto regulation documents from various regions. These regulatory documents are parsed, the information is vectorized using the initial free version of Chroma DB, and then stored waiting to be used for the comparative analysis.

Following the upload, the next stage involves the open source legal document RAG system, which asynchronously processes the user’s file. The system compares the contents of the uploaded document against the vectorized legal corpus extracted from current regulation documents. It detects problematic areas that might include compliance risks, outdated strategies, and inefficient execution. Upon completing the analysis, the application transitions to a detailed results page where the user is presented with a comprehensive report that details every flagged issue. Each flaglists problems with clear indicators and explanations, and the report offers the option to click into more details if the user wishes to understand the context behind an identified risk.

Apart from the primary workflow, the application accommodates additional functionality in the form of automated updates and notifications. In this advanced workflow, background processes periodically run to update regulatory data on a weekly basis, with options available to move to daily or real-time updates as needed. When significant updates or new compliance alerts are detected, the system not only updates its database but also transitions to displaying alert messages on the dashboard, ensuring users are promptly informed of any changes. This integration with the perplexity API further reinforces the real-time search capabilities, helping users receive the latest context and news in the crypto regulation space.

## Settings and Account Management

Even though the initial version of the app does not incorporate extensive user authentication or data security, there is a settings section embedded within the mini app for future-proofing. Here, users can manage preferences such as setting up alert notifications for regulatory updates and customizing how often the data should be updated. Placeholder options are available for managing an account or upgrading to enhanced security measures like encryption and user authentication. After adjusting settings or personal preferences, users can smoothly transition back to the main dashboard where they can continue uploading new documents or reviewing previous reports. This seamless integration between settings and the main app flow ensures that any changes made do not disrupt the overall user experience.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The app is designed to handle common error states with clarity and ease of recovery. If a user attempts to upload an invalid file format or a corrupted document, the system promptly displays an error message that clearly explains the issue and advises the user on the acceptable file types of PDF and DOCX. In cases where connectivity is lost or if there is a problem with the backend process (such as during the scraping or analysis stages), the application displays fallback pages that inform the user of the disruption while providing options to retry the action. Should a document fail to upload completely, the user is given a clear error status along with instructions on how to attempt the upload again. Additionally, if any part of the document analysis process fails, an error message is generated with technical details discreetly noted for debugging purposes and a suggestion to relay the issue if it persists. The design of the error states ensures that users are never left without a clear path forward, providing multiple routes to regain a normal workflow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall user journey with the Crypto Regulatory Compliance Checker is intuitive and tailored for both crypto project developers and legal teams. The experience begins on a welcoming landing page that quickly guides the user into the main dashboard where document uploads are central. Once a document is uploaded, the system handles it immediately by verifying the file, performing scrapes of global regulatory data, and analyzing the document using an advanced open source legal RAG system. The user is then presented with an easy-to-understand report that highlights any compliance risks, outdated strategies, or inefficiencies found in the document, all backed by real regulatory data that is updated on a weekly basis with future potential for more frequent updates.

The app flow integrates seamless transitions between document upload, backend processing, and result reporting while maintaining clarity through visual confirmations and error handling. It ensures that even if errors occur, there are clear instructions and pathways for users to retrace and correct their actions. By the end of their session, users will have a complete picture of how their tokenomics documents align with current crypto regulations and any areas needing improvement, thereby ensuring that they remain compliant with evolving legal standards. This clarity and cohesion across the app make it a robust tool for anyone seeking to maintain regulatory vigilance in the dynamic crypto landscape.
