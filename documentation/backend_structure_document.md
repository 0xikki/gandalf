# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the overall backend setup for the Crypto/Web3 Regulator Checker project. It is designed to be clear and simple so that anyone, regardless of technical background, can understand how the backend is organized and how it functions.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend is designed using a layered approach that separates different parts of the system for clarity and ease of maintenance. The main components include:

- **Framework:** Python with Flask simplifies handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Design Pattern:** Uses a modular structure; different functionalities (upload processing, data scraping, analysis) are kept in separate modules. This means that if one part needs updates, you can make changes without affecting the whole system.
- **Scalability:** The use of vector databases and the ability to swap from Chroma DB to Pinecone ensures that the backend can handle increased data as the user base grows.
- **Performance:** Efficient data processing with Python libraries (like BeautifulSoup for web scraping) and integration with external APIs (such as Perplexity API) to quickly fetch current regulatory data.

## 2. Database Management

The project uses specialized databases to manage and store data:

- **Vector Databases:**
  - **Chroma DB:** Used initially for storing the scraped regulatory data in vector format. It’s free and fits the initial project requirements.
  - **Pinecone (Potential Upgrade):** Planned for future scalability, providing higher performance and efficiency when the amount of data increases.

Data is stored in a way that allows for fast retrieval of relevant segments using vector similarity searches. This means the system can quickly compare user-uploaded documents with the regulatory data.

## 3. Database Schema

Since we are using vector databases rather than traditional SQL databases, our schema is focused on storing vectors and metadata rather than tables and rows.

**Chroma DB / Pinecone Schema Details (Human Readable):**

- **Document ID:** A unique identifier for each document (both for regulatory documents and user uploads).
- **Content Vector:** A numerical representation of the document’s text, generated through AI processing, which is used for similarity searches.
- **Metadata:** Additional information such as the document type (PDF, DOCX), upload date, region (for regulations), and tags specifying legal concerns.
- **Versioning Info:** To track updates, especially for regulatory documents that are updated frequently.

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

The backend communicates with both the front-end and external services through a set of well-structured APIs. The design follows a RESTful approach where each endpoint has a clear, specific purpose. Key endpoints include:

- **Document Upload API:**
  - *Purpose*: Accepts .pdf and .docx files from users.
  - *Functionality*: Extracts text from files and stores the document along with its vector representation.

- **Regulation Data Ingestion API:**
  - *Purpose*: Scrapes and processes global crypto regulation documents.
  - *Functionality*: Regularly fetches new regulatory data and ingests it into the vector database.

- **Analysis API:**
  - *Purpose*: Compares the uploaded document’s vectors against stored regulation vectors using the open-source legal document RAG system.
  - *Functionality*: Returns a detailed report highlighting any compliance risks or outdated strategies.

- **Notification API:**
  - *Purpose*: Sends alerts and notifications to users when new regulations are added or when changes might affect previous analysis.

- **Perplexity API Integration:**
  - *Purpose*: Enhances search capabilities by integrating with the Perplexity API to fetch the latest regulatory updates and context.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The backend is hosted in a cloud environment to ensure high availability and scalability. The main points include:

- **Cloud Providers:** Relying on a reputable cloud provider (such as AWS, GCP, or Azure) ensures a stable and scalable hosting solution.
- **Virtual Servers and Containers:** Running our Python Flask application on virtual servers or containers ensures that scaling the system up or down based on demand is simple and cost-effective.
- **Benefits:**
  - High reliability and uptime
  - Automatic scaling as user demand increases
  - Cost-effectiveness by paying for what is used

## 6. Infrastructure Components

Several components work together to optimize the performance and reliability of the backend:

- **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming requests evenly across the servers, which helps maintain high performance even during traffic spikes.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** Use temporary storage (e.g., Redis or Memcached) to speed up data retrieval for frequently accessed information.
- **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Cache static assets and deliver content quickly to users around the world, boosting overall user experience.
- **Data Ingestion Scheduler:** Automates the scraping and updating of global regulatory documents on a weekly basis (with the potential to increase frequency).

## 7. Security Measures

Security is an important aspect of the backend even though initial requirements do not demand heavy authentication or encryption. Future-proofing is considered in the design:

- **Basic Security Practices:**
  - Input validation to prevent injection attacks during document uploads and API calls.
  - Secure API endpoints by rate limiting and logging requests.

- **Future Enhancements (Optional):**
  - User authentication and authorization using industry standards (like OAuth) if needed.
  - Data encryption both at rest (stored data) and in transit (data sent between services).

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Continuous monitoring and regular maintenance ensure the backend system performs well and remains updated:

- **Monitoring Tools:**
  - Tools like Prometheus or New Relic to keep an eye on server performance, API response times, and overall system health.
  - Log management systems (e.g., ELK Stack) for tracking errors and analyzing usage patterns.

- **Maintenance Strategies:**
  - Regular updates and patches to the Python environment, Flask framework, and other dependencies.
  - Scheduled reviews of database performance and scalability, especially when moving from Chroma DB to Pinecone.
  - Automated backups of regulatory data and user-uploaded content.

## 9. Conclusion and Overall Backend Summary

The backend of the Crypto/Web3 Regulator Checker project is designed with clarity, scalability, and performance in mind. Here are the key takeaways:

- **Architecture:** Modular and scalable, using Python and Flask for the web server and ensuring that all components work together seamlessly.
- **Databases:** Initially utilizing Chroma DB for fast vector similarity searches, with plans to consider Pinecone for future scalability.
- **APIs:** RESTful endpoints facilitate document uploads, regulatory data scraping, analysis via the legal document RAG, and notifications to users.
- **Hosting and Infrastructure:** Hosted on a cloud environment with load balancers, caching, and CDNs to provide a reliable user experience even under high load.
- **Security & Maintenance:** Basic security practices are in place with the option to integrate more robust features as requirements grow, alongside active monitoring and regular updates.

The backend is set up to smartly process, analyze, and deliver regulatory compliance insights, ensuring that users (crypto project developers and legal teams) receive timely, accurate information. Its flexibility and modularity make it a robust foundation for any future enhancements or scale-ups.
