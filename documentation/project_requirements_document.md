# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for Crypto Regulatory Compliance Checker

## 1. Project Overview

The Crypto Regulatory Compliance Checker is a tool designed to help crypto project developers and legal teams evaluate their tokenomics and related documents by comparing them against up-to-date global regulatory information. Users can upload their documents in PDF or DOCX format, and the system will analyze the content to identify compliance risks, outdated strategies, and broad legal concerns by leveraging both scraped regulation data and advanced AI models.

The main purpose of building this tool is to provide an accessible and intelligent assistant that continuously monitors evolving global crypto regulations. Success will be measured by the tool’s ability to accurately flag problematic areas in user documents, provide actionable insights, and update regularly with the latest regulatory information. Additionally, the tool aims to serve as a first line of defense for users who need to ensure that their tokenomics align with current legal standards, even though it does not replace professional legal advice.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A user interface for document upload supporting .pdf and .docx formats.
*   A pre-submission pop-up agreement that informs users that the tool is not a replacement for legal advice.
*   Scraping functionality to collect global crypto regulation documents.
*   Parsing scraped regulation data and populating a vector database using Chroma DB (with a future path to Pinecone).
*   Implementation of an open source legal document Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrated with the Perplexity API for analysis.
*   A front-end mini app that displays a detailed results dashboard with flagged issues and drill-down functionality for more detail.
*   An alert system that notifies users when new regulations or compliance risks are found.
*   Scheduled weekly updates for regulatory data (with a future option for daily or real-time updates).

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Advanced user authentication and data encryption for uploads (to be considered in future iterations).
*   Real-time or daily data updates in the initial phase.
*   Extensive UI/UX design guidelines beyond a simple, user-friendly interface.
*   Integration with external enterprise legal consultancy systems.
*   Additional file formats beyond .pdf and .docx during the initial release.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user journey starts when a crypto project developer or legal team member accesses the Crypto Regulatory Compliance Checker. On landing, users are greeted by a simple and clean dashboard with an option to upload their tokenomics document. Users then drag-and-drop or manually select their file for upload. Before submission, a pop-up agreement reminds them that the tool is not a replacement for professional legal advice and that they assume full responsibility for the use of the information provided.

After agreeing, users submit their document and the system begins to process the file. Behind the scenes, the tool parses the document, initiates comparisons with the latest scraped global regulatory data stored in the vector database, and runs through the RAG system to identify issues. Once the analysis is complete, users are redirected to a results dashboard where flagged compliance risks and problematic areas are clearly highlighted. They can click on each area to view additional details and supporting context, while notifications alert them about any important regulatory updates.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**\
    • The system should process and analyze uploaded documents within a reasonable timeframe (ideally under a minute for standard tokenomics documents).\
    • The dashboard should render within 2-3 seconds for a smooth user experience.
*   **Security & Compliance:**\
    • While no advanced security measures are required initially, the design must allow for future incorporation of encryption and user authentication. • Data handling should follow best practices to keep user uploads confidential until further security upgrades are implemented.
*   **Scalability & Reliability:**\
    • The architecture should support scheduled weekly updates and be designed for future scalability, including potential real-time updates. • The system should handle multiple file uploads and concurrent analyses without performance degradation.
*   **Usability:**\
    • The user interface must be straightforward and easy to navigate, even for non-technical users. • Provide clear feedback to users during file upload, processing, and notifications.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**\
    • The initial version does not require full-scale user authentication or advanced data security measures. • Regulation data will be scraped from all regions, which might introduce variations in data formatting and quality. • The vector database used is Chroma DB for the initial phase with a planned upgrade to Pinecone. • Updates are scheduled weekly initially, meaning some regulatory changes may not be immediately available.
*   **Assumptions:**\
    • Developers and legal teams using the tool understand that it is not a substitute for legal advice. • The available APIs (like the Perplexity API) and open source RAG system will function as expected and integrate smoothly. • Users will have modern web browsers to interact with the mini app, and basic documentation support is sufficient. • The underlying infrastructure can handle the scraping workload and data processing volume without significant delays during the weekly update cycle.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Data Quality & Consistency:**\
    • Scraping documents from all global regions may result in inconsistent formatting or incomplete data sets. Consider building robust parsing logic and fallback mechanisms.
*   **Regulatory Changes:**\
    • Given the dynamic nature of crypto regulations, there may be time lags between updates. For now, weekly updates are used, but this might cause gaps in compliance accuracy until real-time capabilities are added.
*   **Scalability of the Vector Database:**\
    • Using Chroma DB as the initial vector database might limit scalability. Monitoring performance and planning the transition to Pinecone is critical as user volume increases.
*   **User Expectations:**\
    • Users might misconstrue the tool as a full legal advisory service. The pop-up disclaimer helps mitigate this risk, but careful user education and clear communication throughout the interface are important.
*   **Integration with External APIs:**\
    • Reliance on the Perplexity API and other third-party integrations can introduce potential downtime or rate limits. Implement error handling and caching mechanisms to alleviate these issues during temporary outages.
