# Initial Audit Report
_Updated April 2, 2024_

## MVP Blockers 🚫
These items must be completed before MVP release for internal testing:
1. User Authentication & Session Management
   - Basic user registration/login
   - Session state management
   - Frontend auth integration
   - Essential permission controls

## Pending Items 🔄
1. Post-MVP Features
   - Advanced permission management
   - Background task queue
   - Enhanced error recovery
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Virus scanning and malware detection

## Implementation Issues 🚨
1. MVP Critical
   - Session management needs implementation
   - Basic auth flow missing

2. Non-MVP
   - Background task queue pending
   - Advanced permission system

## Recommendations 📋
1. MVP Requirements (Immediate)
   - Implement basic user registration/login
   - Add session state management
   - Create essential permission controls
   - Integrate auth with frontend

2. Post-MVP Improvements
   - Enhance error recovery
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Implement advanced security features

## Risk Assessment 🎯
1. MVP Risks (Must Address)
   - Missing user authentication
   - Lack of session management
   - Basic permission controls

2. Post-MVP Risks
   - Resource cleanup
   - Code documentation
   - UI/UX refinements
   - Test coverage expansion
   - File scanning implementation

## Next Steps 👣
1. MVP Implementation (Priority)
   - Create user authentication system
   - Implement session management
   - Add basic permission controls
   - Integrate with frontend

2. Documentation
   - Update API documentation
   - Create user guides
   - Document error codes

## Conclusion 📝
The project has established a strong foundation with secure file storage, rate limiting, CORS configuration, security headers, request validation, WebSocket integration, robust error handling, and performance optimization. To achieve MVP status for internal testing, we must implement basic user authentication and session management. These features are critical for proper user tracking and system security during internal testing.

The MVP phase will focus solely on essential authentication and session management, while additional features like advanced permissions, virus scanning, and malware detection will be addressed post-MVP.
